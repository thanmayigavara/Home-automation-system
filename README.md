Home Automation System 

This project presents a Home Automation System that enables users to remotely control home appliances such as lights and fans using IoT platforms like Blynk . The system aims to enhance comfort, convenience, and energy efficiency by allowing real-time control through a smartphone or web application.

Objective:

To design and implement a working prototype that demonstrates remote switching of multiple household appliances through an IoT interface, with minimal manual intervention.

 
 How It Works:

1. The microcontroller is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi.


2. The smartphone or web app sends control commands (e.g., ON/OFF) via Blynk protocol.


3. The microcontroller receives these commands and triggers the appropriate relay, which turns the device ON or OFF.


4. The system provides instant feedback, allowing users to monitor the current state of each device in real-time.


Remote Access: Control appliances from anywhere using internet connectivity.

Multiple Device Control: Supports multiple outputs (e.g., one light and one fan).
